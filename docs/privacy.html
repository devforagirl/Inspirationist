    <p>Inspirationist <strong>does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII)</strong>. We do not track your browsing history, your location, or any personal data on the websites you visit.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All your preferences (such as font style, font size, and bold settings) are stored locally within your Chrome browser profile using <code>chrome.storage.sync</code>. This information is only used to maintain your personalized experience across your devices and is never accessed by us.</p>
